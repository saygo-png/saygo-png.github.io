<h1>Saygo</h1>
<p>
  Polish. Play a lot of Overwatch — down to find more people to play with.
  learning Finnish, want to move to Finland. Don't like dealing with people's emotions.
  Have an always shifting sleep cycle — often sleep during the day.
  Would rather not write about myself.

<h2>Art</h2>
<p>
  I used do art but it no longer brings any joy to me.
  <a href="https://www.artstation.com/saygo">Here</a> is my dead ArtStation profile.
</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
  I despise all proprietary software. I use NixOS; dotfiles for it are available on my
<a href="https://github.com/saygo-png" target="_blank">Github</a> profile. Trying to learn programming but I'm a moron. Most interested in functional languages like Haskell and Nix. I've written some personal utilities and released <a href="https://github.com/saygo-png/drugTracker2" target="_blank">one program</a> in Haskell.
