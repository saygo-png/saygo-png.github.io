<h1>Saygo</h1>
<p>
  I'm Polish and I enjoy video games, especially competitive ones like Overwatch 2 (peaked in masters). Down to find more people to play with.
  I'm learning Finnish and dream of living in Finland one day.
  I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder">schizoid personality disorder</a> (not schizophrenia) and barely walk outside. Sometimes I write bad blog posts here.
</p>

<h2>Art</h2>
<p>
  I was once passionate about art but then I went to artschool, or maybe my personality disorder got the best of me.
  <a href="https://www.artstation.com/saygo">Here</a> is my dead ArtStation profile.
</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
  I despise all proprietary software. I use NixOS and hate it, dotfiles are available on my
<a href="https://github.com/saygo-png" target="_blank">github</a> profile. Trying to learn programming but I'm bad at it right now. I'm most interested in functional languages like Haskell and Nix. I have written some personal utilities and have released <a href="https://github.com/saygo-png/drugTracker2" target="_blank">one program</a> in Haskell.
